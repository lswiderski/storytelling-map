# storytelling-map
Proof of concept Plugin for travel journal with text tracking map

Inspired by https://tympanus.net/Development/StorytellingMap/
I found https://github.com/atlefren/storymap 
decided to get rid of jQuery and add some functionality

DEMO: https://raw.githack.com/lswiderski/storytelling-map/main/demo/index.html

In the future, I would like to create a wordpress plugin based on this feature
