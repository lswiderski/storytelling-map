              settings. Different markers appear at different zoom levels:

            <p>
              You've experienced hierarchical navigation through three great
              European cities. The use of minZoom and maxZoom settings created a
              natural flow from city overview to specific landmarks.
            </p>
            <p>
              This technique is perfect for travel guides, city tours, or any
              application where you want to show broad categories first, then
              drill down into specific locations. The markers automatically show
              and hide based on the zoom level, creating an intuitive user
              experience.
