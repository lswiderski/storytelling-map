            <p>
              This demo uses <strong>CartoDB Dark Matter</strong> tiles instead
              of the default OpenStreetMap tiles. You can use any
              Leaflet-compatible tile provider to customize the appearance of
              your map!
            </p>
            <p>
              Popular options include: CartoDB, Mapbox, Stamen, ESRI, and more.
              Each provides different visual styles from satellite imagery to
              artistic renditions.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The storytelling map library allows you to customize the map tiles
            using the
            <code>createMap</code> option. Simply create your Leaflet map with
            your preferred tile layer and return it.

            <h2>World Wonders Tour</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to a tour of some of the world's most famous landmarks and
              wonders. Notice the dark, minimalist map style - perfect for
              highlighting colored markers and creating a modern, sleek
              aesthetic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Different map tiles can dramatically change the look and feel of
              your storytelling experience. Dark themes work great for evening
              or space-themed stories.

            <h2>Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt</h2>
            <p>
              The Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest and largest of the three
              pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex. It is the oldest of the
              Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain
              largely intact.
            </p>
            <p>
              Built around 2560 BC over a 20-year period, the pyramid was
              constructed as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu. It stood as the tallest
              man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years.

            <h2>Great Wall of China</h2>
            <p>
              The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of
              stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials. It was
              built along the historical northern borders of China to protect
              against invasions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stretching over 13,000 miles, the wall was built over many
              centuries by different dynasties. It is one of the most impressive
              architectural feats in human history.

            <h2>Taj Mahal, India</h2>
            <p>
              The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern
              bank of the river Yamuna in Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by
              the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favorite
              wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Considered one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture, the
              Taj Mahal combines elements from Islamic, Persian, Ottoman
              Turkish, and Indian architectural styles.

            <h2>Machu Picchu, Peru</h2>
            <p>
              Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern
              Cordillera of southern Peru. It is situated on a mountain ridge
              2,430 meters above sea level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Built by the Inca emperor Pachacuti around 1450, it was abandoned
              a century later during the Spanish Conquest. It remained largely
              unknown until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to
              international attention in 1911.

            <h2>Colosseum, Italy</h2>
            <p>
              The Colosseum is an oval amphitheater in the center of Rome,
              Italy. Built of travertine limestone, tuff, and brick-faced
              concrete, it was the largest amphitheater ever built at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Construction began under Emperor Vespasian in AD 72 and was
              completed in AD 80 under his successor Titus. The Colosseum could
              hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators.
